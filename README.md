# Deja: A Hierarchical Data Structure for Organized Storage

## 📌 Overview
Deja is an indexed, hierarchical data structure designed for efficient categorization and retrieval of data. It enables structured storage using a dictionary-based mapping, where each entry is assigned a unique index, allowing systematic organization and quick access.





## Features

- Indexed Storage – Organizes data efficiently using unique indexes.
- Flexible Management – Easily add, update, and remove categories.
- Error Handling – Prevents duplicate entries and invalid operations.
- Efficient Deletion – Supports category-based and index-based removal
## Usage/Examples

```python
from deja import Deja

# Initialize Deja
ds = Deja()

# Add categories with items
ds.add("Fruit", ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"])
ds.add("Dairy", ["Milk", "Cheese"])
ds.add("Computer", ["CPU"])

# Remove a category by name
ds.removeby_cat("Dairy")
ds.removeby_idx(1)

# Display stored data
ds.display()
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
#### 🔹 What is Deja?
Deja is a hierarchical, index-driven data structure that organizes information efficiently, allowing structured storage and quick retrieval.
#### 🔹 How does Deja store data?
Each entry is mapped to an index, with categories acting as keys containing associated item lists. This allows precise lookups and modifications.
#### 🔹 Can I remove items by category or index?
Yes! Deja supports removal by category name and removal by index, giving flexibility when managing stored data.
#### 🔹 Does Deja prevent duplicate categories?
Yes. If a category already exists, Deja raises an error to maintain structured storage.
#### 🔹 Is Deja suitable for large-scale applications?
Yes! While lightweight, it can be expanded for sorting, searching, serialization, and persistent storage.
